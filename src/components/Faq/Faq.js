                      but also a serious step that requires proper care. One of
                      the most important stages is the healing period, which
                      takes about three weeks. Our masters use a special healing
                      plastic, which helps to heal the skin faster and safer.
                      This plastic is glued after the tattoo and keeping for 3-5
                      days. During these days you can take a shawer. After
                      removing the plastic you should wash the tattoo with
                      non-parfume soap and apply a thin layer of special healing
                      cream, also for small tattoos is good to use coconut oil
                      instead of cream. During two weeks you should repeat the
                      process of washing the tattoo with soap and applying
                      cream/oil 5-6 times a day, so that the skin heals faster
                      and the tattoo looks its best. But don't forget that
                      during this period you should not exercise, sunbathe, have
                      sauna or salarium. It is also worth remembering that the
                      healing skin can itch, but donâ€™t scratch it. Because
                      scratching can lead to infection and damage to the tattoo.
                      It is also important to maintain hygiene and not to touch
                      the tattoo with dirty hands. For about 3 more weeks, the
                      upper layer of the epidermis will be restored and the
                      tattoo will have a characteristic shine. Then the skin
                      will become completely matte. In general, tattoo care is a
                      responsible and important process that requires patience
                      and attention. But if you follow the rules and
                      recommendations of the master, your tattoo will look
                      beautiful and will keep the brightness of colors for a
                      long time.`,

                    and the more difficult it is to access, the higher the cost.
                    The second factor is the complexity of the drawing and its
                    detailing. If the sketch will be very detailed, the cost
                    will be higher. The third factor is the cost of consumables
                    and rent. The master uses only premium grade consumables
                    that ensure the safety and quality of the tattoo. And

                    A tattoo is not only a beautiful decoration of our body, but
                    also a serious step that requires proper care. One of the

                    about three weeks. Our masters use a special healing

                    plastic is glued after the tattoo and keeping for 3-5 days.
                    During these days you can take a shower. After removing the
                    plastic you should wash the tattoo with non-parfume soap and
                    apply a thin layer of special healing cream, also for small
                    tattoos it is good to use coconut oil instead of cream. During
                    two weeks you should repeat the process of washing the
                    tattoo with soap and applying cream/oil 5-6 times a day, so
                    that the skin heals faster and the tattoo looks its best.
                    <br />But don't forget that during this period you should not
                    exercise, sunbath, have sauna or salarium. It is also worth
                    remembering that the healing skin can itch, but donâ€™t
                    scratch it. Because scratching can lead to infection and
                    damage to the tattoo. It is also important to maintain
                    hygiene and not to touch the tattoo with dirty hands. For
                    about 3 more weeks, the upper layer of the epidermis will be
                    restored and the tattoo will have a characteristic shine.
                    Then the skin will become completely matte. In general,
                    tattoo care is a responsible and important process that
                    requires patience and attention. But if you follow the rules
                    and recommendations of the master, your tattoo will look
                    beautiful and will keep the brightness of colors for a long
                    time.
